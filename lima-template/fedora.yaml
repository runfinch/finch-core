# BASIC CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================== #

# Default values in this YAML file are specified by `null` instead of Lima's "builtin default" values,
# so they can be overridden by the $LIMA_HOME/_config/default.yaml mechanism documented at the end of this file.

# Arch: "default", "x86_64", "aarch64".
# 🟢 Builtin default: "default" (corresponds to the host architecture)
arch: null

# OpenStack-compatible disk image.
# 🟢 Builtin default: null (must be specified)
# 🔵 This file: Fedora 42 Cloud Base images
images:
  - location: "<image_location>"
    arch: "<image_arch>"
    digest: "<image_digest>"

# CPUs: if you see performance issues, try limiting cpus to 1.
# 🟢 Builtin default: 4
cpus: null

# Memory size
# 🟢 Builtin default: "4GiB"
memory: "4GiB"

# Disk size
# 🟢 Builtin default: "100GiB"
disk: null

# 9p was broken in Linux v6.9, v6.10, and v6.11 (used by Fedora 41).
# The issue was fixed in Linux v6.12-rc5 (https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/be2ca38) and is available in Fedora 42.
mountType: reverse-sshfs

# Expose host directories to the guest, the mount point might be accessible from all UIDs in the guest
# 🟢 Builtin default: null (Mount nothing)
# 🔵 This file: Mount the home as read-only, /tmp/lima as writable
mounts:
- location: "~"
  # Configure the mountPoint inside the guest.
  # 🟢 Builtin default: value of location
  mountPoint: null
  # CAUTION: `writable` SHOULD be false for the home directory.
  # Setting `writable` to true is safe for finch use case.
  # Reference: https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/discussions/550

  sshfs:
    # Enabling the SSHFS cache will increase performance of the mounted filesystem, at
    # the cost of potentially not reflecting changes made on the host in a timely manner.
    # Warning: It looks like PHP filesystem access does not work correctly when
    # the cache is disabled.
    # 🟢 Builtin default: true
    cache: null
    # SSHFS has an optional flag called 'follow_symlinks'. This allows mounts
    # to be properly resolved in the guest os and allow for access to the
    # contents of the symlink. As a result, symlinked files & folders on the Host
    # system will look and feel like regular files directories in the Guest OS.
    # 🟢 Builtin default: false
    followSymlinks: null
    # SFTP driver, "builtin" or "openssh-sftp-server". "openssh-sftp-server" is recommended.

    protocolVersion: null
    # The number of bytes to use for 9p packet payload, where 4KiB is the absolute minimum.
    # 🟢 Builtin default: "128KiB"
    msize: null
    # Specifies a caching policy. Valid options are: "none", "loose", "fscache" and "mmap".
    # Try choosing "mmap" or "none" if you see a stability issue with the default "fscache".
    # See https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/9p.txt

  # NOTE: when the instance name is "default", the builtin default value is set to
  # 60022 for backward compatibility.
  localPort: 0
  # Load ~/.ssh/*.pub in addition to $LIMA_HOME/_config/user.pub .
